<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 20 || Team Name: Greg</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>Corey O'Connell, Daniel Gilbert, Broderick Thomsen, Ramisa Fayez</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attend a concert</li>
        <li>Become a member</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success can be evaluated by concert attendance, i.e. if there are more people at the concert, and if more people become a member.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>17 - 26 years of age. The website is designed to appeal to the youths. The reason for this is that it is one of the client's requests. A website is an excellent domain to reach out to a youthful audience. This will be achieved by using a clean, but bright layout. Dropdown menus will help with minimising clicks needed to get to where people want to go. This is important for younger viewers, as they will not have to trawl through large amounts of text before finding what they need. Consequently, for any future guest performers who also visit the website, they will be greeted by a fun-looking, but profesional website. As such, they fall into the secondary target audience, as per the client's requests.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Become a Member - form for joining the orchestra</p>
<p>Events - upcoming events/tickets and news about the orchestra. Also has a link to view past events.</p>
<p>Our Orchestra - a sort of landing page for the following four pages: special guests, life members, committee, and history. There will also be a link to download the rules and repertoire on this page.</p>
<p>Gallery - a gallery of photos from previous performances</p>
<p>Contact - where/how to contact the orchestra.</p>
