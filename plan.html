<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 20 || Team Name: Greg</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>Corey O'Connell, Daniel Gilbert, Broderick Thomsen, Ramisa Fayez</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attend a concert - we want more people to be encouraged to go to the performances by BRO</li>
        <li>Become a member - we want more people to become involved with BRO, be it through donations or becoming a player, or other such responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Secondary goal: We want to entice guest performers to play/sing with the BRO by making a welcoming & informative website.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success can be evaluated by concert attendance, i.e. if there are more people at the concert, and if more people become a member. The secondary goal is successful if there are more guest artists contacting the BRO for an opportunity to perform.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>17 - 26 years of age. The website is designed to appeal to the youths. The reason for this is that it is one of the client's requests. A website is an excellent domain to reach out to a youthful audience. This will be achieved by using a clean, but bright layout. Dropdown menus will help with minimising clicks needed to get to where people want to go. This is important for younger viewers, as they will not have to trawl through large amounts of text before finding what they need. Consequently, for any future guest performers who also visit the website, they will be greeted by a fun-looking, but profesional website. As such, they fall into the secondary target audience, as per the client's requests.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Index has snippets of the other pages. Brief headlines and descriptions with a link to follow up.</p>
